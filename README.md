# FloatingViews
Just messing around with Swift and UIDynamicAnimations


### Latest Update ###
This code now supports iOS 9, Xcode 7, and Swift 2.0

I have also found out that if you have a UIViewController with a name that constructed like so: (UIView)Controller then the View Controller will have the same properties as the UIView and will cause the app to crash when you try to display said UIViewController.
